# Bhaiya Cheese Maggi

## Introduction

This is a simple **token based** **web-app** with a potential to become a native application for Android and iOS.

## What we have done?

Here, we have created an app that takes your **order** for BBC Canteen and yields a database accessible to the **admin** which is potentially the Canteen Counter.

Instead of having a chaotic situation, this app permits the customers to order food in a easy and sophisticated way and helps in maintaining a clean record of services and items to be delivered for the admin.

The above provides the idea regarding the basic implementation of the supposed web-app. It is quite intuitive for the purpose of placing orders and the result of such orders is the formation of an extensive database.

**Further build-ups can be easily implemented to make the front-end look far more attractive like the Login Page prototype provided under the Prototypes section.**

## Why to use this app?

The purpose of this web-app is to form a token based service for the **often crowded BBC Canteen** of IIIT-H.

Getting food at BBC can become tiresome sometimes. Often we are stuck with a communication problem in midst of ordering. Even though her shouting "Bhaiya Cheese Maggi" works, it often causes a lot of confusion and commotion.

What we plan to achieve is a **simple token-based service** which **prevents** such confusion and commotion and **notifies** the person who ordered the respective dish when it is ready. 

Further efforts as to make sure that the person has made payment for the food he has order **can be implemented** as to prevent occurrence of such confusions.

### Pros:

- *Faster service at BBC* - After all, who doesn't want their Paneer Cheese Dosa and Cheese Maggi faster?
- *Avoiding Commotion* - No, you don't have to shout "Aunty ho gaya kya" every time. Chill out and relax with your friends. Or, maybe approach that guy/girl you have had always liked and make conversations with him/her.
- *Make life easier -* There cannot be any doubt that if this project is developed upon further (based on the prototypes laid upon by us), it would make life a lot easier for the workers at BBC Canteen. No more they have to ponder upon and be overwhelmed at the sheer volume of orders being placed, orders being cancelled and orders being changed. After their service of providing us with food, day after day, don't we owe it to them?
- *Avoiding Confusion -* No more confusions about who ordered first and whose dish it is. The proper tokenised system that we provide here as a solution solves all these problems and makes a hell lot of difference in your mood for the day. After all it is the small things that matter most in life.

### Cons:

- **Did you find any at all?**

We have tried our best to provide a foolproof basic solution. It lacks some integrations that we would like to make later as mentioned above which will make this system not just awesome but amazing and cater very much to our beloved Cheese Maggi and  Masala Dosas.

- Some **clean templates has been provided for a many unimplemented applications which are meant to express the potential of the app, given time**
