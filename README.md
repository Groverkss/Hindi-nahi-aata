# Bhaiya Cheese Maggi

## What is this?

This is a web-app with a potential to become a native application for Android and iOS.

## Why to use this app?

The purpose of this web-app is to form a token based service for the often crowded BBC Canteen of IIIT-H.

Getting food at BBC can become tiresome sometimes. Often we are stuck with a communication problem in midst of ordering. Even though her shouting "Bhaiya Cheese Maggi" works it often causes a lot of confusion and commotion.

What we plan to achieve is a simple token-based service that alerts the person who ordered the repective dish when it is ready. A further effort as to make sure that the person has made payment for the food he has order can be implemented as to prevent occurrence of such confusions.

## Implementation

- Simple UI (can be easily modified further) with the help of HTML, CSS and JS
- Use of Flask as framework and SQLAlchemy for the database.
